                    <p><strong>Design Challenge:</strong> Propose a new, small, focused feature that adds functionality to Reddit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Achievement Tracker for Reddit</p>
                    <p><strong>Team & Timeline</strong> This was a solo project; September 2nd, 2025 - September 4th, 2025</p>
                    <p><strong>Role & Responsibilities:</strong> UX Designer; in charge of creating clear wireframes that effectively depict the functionality of the new focused feature I created for Reddit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Figma.</p>
                </div><br>
                <h2 class="proj-header">Process & Approach</h2><br>
                <p><strong>Research Methods:</strong> Because of the limited time to complete this project, I could not conduct user research with real people, and, of course, couldn't meet with anyone in Reddit leadership. So, I used U-M GPT (Generative AI) to conduct secondary research, create mock stakeholder interview notes, and create a user persona.</p>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <div class="persona">
                        <img src="./images/User Persona.png" alt="User Persona">
                    </div>
                    <div class="stake-interview">
                        <img src="./images/Stakeholder Interview.png" alt="Mock Stakeholder Interview Notes">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Design Solution:</strong> I reviewed the persona's pain points, motivations, and goals and cross referenced it with the mock stakeholder interview notes. I highlighted that Reddit strives to enable content discovery and foster user empowerment and innovative engagement. Additionally, the persona would like to learn and discover from diverse perspectives and receive encouragement and recognition for their contributions. Because of these points, I decided to design a feature that allows users to track their progress in getting Achievement badges. A user receives achievement badges when they make meaningful contributions to the site (satisfies Reddit's goals) and a progress checker would allow the user to see their contributions as well as receive recognition through receiving the Achievement badge (satisfies the persona's wants and needs).</p><br>
                <p><strong>Accounting for Limitations:</strong> Moreover, this new feature may allow for users to abuse its functionality by spam posting or commenting, or overall contributing meaningless content just to receive the achievement badge (which goes against Reddit's goals). To prevent this,  users would only be allowed to track the progress of 1 achievement at a time, and their engagement will be monitored.</p>
